# Atvero Front End Developer Test

- The aim of this test is to give us an idea about how you approach the development and maintenance of web applications.
- We are looking for a solution that shows how you build usable, maintainable and robust software.
- The test is based on an overly simplified version of our business domain.

## Objective 1: Fetch Documents
Fetch all documents from the provided API endpoint (https://65ea11eec9bf92ae3d3b07d0.mockapi.io/api/v1/documents) and display them on the page. Each document should display at least its title and description.

## Objective 2: Document Details
Implement a feature where clicking on a document displays its full details, including its title, description, and any other relevant information available from the API.

## Objective 3: Search Functionality
Implement a search functionality allowing users to search for documents by their titles. As the user types in the search input, dynamically filter the list of documents based on the search query.

## Objective 4: Responsive Design
Ensure that your application is responsive and displays well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Objective 5: Error Handling
Handle errors gracefully. Display a friendly error message if the API request fails or if no documents are returned.

## Deliverables

- If you're proficient in Melange/ReScript, we'd prefer its usage. If you're not familiar with Reason ML but have expertise in TypeScript, opt for TypeScript. Otherwise, default to JavaScript.

- Your code should have good test coverage, whether this is unit, integration or E2E.

- Your solution should be delivered via GitHub. If you are not able to fork this original repository publicly then please fork to a private repository and then provide us with the zip file from the download option in GitHub.

## Guidance

- Showing your commit history is recommended so that we can see your approach.

- You can take as long as you need to complete this assignment. But do remember that this is throwaway code and the aim is to demonstrate your approach rather than build a complete system.

- You do not need to deploy the application.

- If you have forked our repo then your solution will be visible to others, so please delete your repo once it has been reviewed.
